The Agrobiodiversity RDC was created in 2006 incorporating the Biotechnology Unit, the
projects to improve productivity of beans, cassava, rice and tropical forages and the Genetic
Resource Unit (GRU). This RDC builds upon the conservation of plant genetic resources;
makes a major effort in research to improve the germplasm available through partners to
rural communities; and contributes to the development of an appropriate policy environment.
In order to advance in this challenge CIAT conserves genetic resources of beans, cassava and
tropical forage. In collaboration with IRRI and WARDA, CIAT carries out specific and unique
rice research applied to the Latin American tropics while also maintaining through the GRU a
regional rice collection for LAC.
Important aspects of this RDC research are carried out in collaboration with two CGIAR
Challenge Programs: HarvestPlus CP on Biofortification, co‐managed by CIAT with IFPRI,
enhances the micronutrient content of food crops, including beans and cassava; and
Generation CP seeking advances in science for the utilization of genetic resources.  This RDC has its strength in the balance and integration of conventional plant breeding with a
large array of biotechnological techniques including molecular markers, genomics,
proteomics, tissue culture and genetic transformation. Research also develops basic tools and
technologies that delineate the molecular genetic basis of cassava, beans, rice and tropical
forages, underpinning crop improvement and the development of innovative agricultural
practices. This RDC is organized around these four PLs with a set of specific products/outputs
associated with each product lineThe Panel identifies that the leadership of this RDC is recognized and individual project
leaders engage their personnel and resources within their projects in an efficient manner. Staff
training and learning is very strong, resulting in motivated, dedicated and effective research
teams. The CCER conducted in May 2006 pointed out that CIAT’s Agrobiodiversity group has

achieved an impressive degree of success in raising external funds for specific as well as
broad projects (HarvestPlus CP, AgroSalud, CLAYUCA, FLAR, and the Generation CP) due
to the excellent reputation of the group for the quality of the research that it conducts. The 6th
EPMR Panel endorses the findings of the CCER regarding the excellent quality of the science
and scientists of the SBA RDC. Both are held in high regard in the international scientific
community.  
4.2 Conservation and use of tropical genetic resources; genetic resources unit (GRU)
Few countries possess the resources needed to ensure that their germplasm conservation
needs are satisfied. CGIAR germplasm conservation and utilization activities produce a large
impact through the generation of this International public good. CIAT is located in a
continent that is rich in unique genetic resources. CIAT has the global mandate to collect,
conserve, characterize, document, and distribute germplasm of cassava, common beans and
tropical forages.  
CIAT has the globally most important collections of cassava, common bean, and tropical
forages. The number of registrations from CIAT (formally designated in trust by FAO) rank
highest in the international collection (Table 4.1). Its importance in terms of diversity and free
availability to countries all over the world is immeasurable, especially for those located in the
tropics of America, Africa and Asia.As a CGIAR Center, CIAT is expected to play an important role in contributing to the
implementation of the international treaty on International Plant Genetic Resources for Food
and Agriculture, which is the principal global legally‐binding intergovernmental policy
framework governing the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources for food
and agriculture. Interpretation and compliance with the requirements of this treaty are an
important responsibility, and one that is currently being handled well by the GRU leader.
An important GRU goal is to minimize the chance of losing accessions within the collection
through seed deterioration or catastrophic event. CIAT has taken several important actions
since the last EPMR that have reduced this risk. Regeneration cycles have been shortened,
storage equipment has been upgraded, and the duplication of CIAT mandate collections by
distributing accessions to CIMMYT (beans and forages) and CIP (cassava), is underway.CIAT MTPs from 2000 to 2007 have consistently reported achieving targets for important
outputs including: conservation and multiplication of the mandated crop, characterization of
genetic diversity of cultivated species, characterization of associated organisms, genomes and
gene combinations used to broaden the genetic base of mandate crops and associated
organisms. Progress in long‐term conservation of the collections is given in Table 4.3.  
The GRU has been very active in the provision of materials to users. GRU has implemented a
web‐based system for requesting accessions that has facilitated an increase in materials
distributed. In 2000‐2006 37,536 samples of cassava, beans and tropical forage material were
sent to partners (Table 4.4). Another development in the GRU has been the implementation of
a bar coding system to handle accession data. This system minimizes mistakes in managing
the large number of accessions in the collections. The GRU also contributes to CIAT’s basic
research effort in understanding relationships between landraces and wild relatives, in the
understanding of the population structure of beans and cassava, and the evolution of these
species A comprehensive evaluation of the GRU was completed in October 2006 by the CGIAR
System‐wide Genetic Resources Program. The opinion expressed in the review was that
“CIAT GRU is among the best found in the world”, and that CIAT GRU capacity to fulfill its
responsibilities has improved substantially over the past three years.  The GRU unit leader is
widely recognized as the leading bean genetic resource specialist in the world, as well as
being among the world’s leading experts in CIAT’s other mandate crops.Recent cuts in CIAT staff have reduced GRU capacity to undertake important characterization
work to a minimum. The potential payoff to characterization work has increased due to
advances in functional genomics. Loss of essential disciplinary capacity (in entomology, plant
pathology, virology, and plant physiology) could endanger the ability to accomplish GRU’s
mission. A further risk to the unit is the heavy reliance in GRU on a single scientist. CIAT
should be aware of the need to groom replacements for this key senior scientist.  
The lack of access to specialist disciplinary support is an issue across all breeding programs
that are part of the Agrobiodiversity RDC.  
[#3] Hence, the Panel recommends that CIAT support at least one entomologist, one
pathologist, one plant physiologist, and one virologist to provide disciplinary support
across the Agrobiodiversity RDC.
