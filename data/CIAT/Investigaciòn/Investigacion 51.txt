Number of Research Scientists: 105; Number of Staff: 1,441.
Scientific Fields of Interest: Agriculture; biology; biochemistry; engineering; environment.
Main Lines of Research and Training Activities: Institute pursues wide-ranging programmes in rice
cultiviation and production examining isses related to irrigation, rainfed lowland and upland rice fields,
floodprone rice fields.
Major Scientific Results or Products: Advancement of rice-related knowledge and production
technologies that are environmentally, socially and economically sound and that benefit present and
future generations of rice producers and consumers.
Main Research Facilities Available: Service building; engineering shops; genebank and biochemistry
laboratory; library and documentation service building, bookstore, visitorsâ€™ centre, exhibition, and
conference services, IRRI Riceworld Museum; communication and publication services building; training
rooms and audiovisual facilities; biofertilizer building; greenhouses and screenhouses; field stations;
containment facility.
Future Development Plans: Research: To extend testing of higher yielding new plant types to NARS
and incorporate new plant types that are resistant to major pests and diseases; link research on soil
processes to farm practices that increase income and enhance productivity; increase transfer of
knowledge-based technologies to farmers, particularly with respect to reduced inputs for pest
management; raise productivity of rainfed rice systems through rice varieties tolerant of extreme water
condition. International Services: To increase international rice seedbank collection of land races and wild
species of rice, expand activities of International Network for Genetic Evaluation of Rice (INGER) to
Mediterranean and West and Central Asia; launch non-seed-based technology evaluation network
(CREMNET).
