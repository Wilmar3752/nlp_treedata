Scientific Fields of Interest: Forestry and Ecology.
Main Lines of Research and Training Activities: (1) Research in the field of forestry, ecology and
related sciences. The thrust area is ecology, regeneration, tending and management of forests, utilization
of forest products including non-wood forest products, forest inventory methods, watershed
management, socio-legal aspects of forestry, forestry operations, forest fires and nutrient budgeting,
plant systematics, forest mycology and pathology, bio-fertilizers forest entomology, forest soils and
application of biotechnology in forestry. (2) Training and education in plantation technology, wood
science technology, pulp and paper technology, seed technology and management, mycorrhiza. MSc in
forestry and MSc in wood science and technology.
Major Scientific Results or Products: Developed arsenic copper chromate for wood preservation;
pulping techniques for tropical hardwoods and bamboos; control measures for termites, insects and
pests of sal, sissoo, teak and babul; hybrids of eucalyptus capable of producing higher biomass;
developed modern seed orchards of teak and semal and protocol for tissue culture of eucalyptus;
developed methods for ecological rehabilitation of mined areas; extracted industrial and other chemicals
from wood wastes and non-wood forest products; developed techniques for production of synthetic
lignosulphonate from alkali pulping spent liquor; designed solar seasoning kiln; developed new wood
preservatives and standardized treatment methods for different timber; developed composite woods and
fibre boards from wood/agricultural residues; developed substitute for bark of Machilus mcrantha
(JICAT), used as binder for making agarbattis; developed eco-friendly vegetable dyes; developed
ammonia fumigation techniques to bring out markings and colour comparable to decorative walnut on
plain looking woods like eucalyptus.
Main Research Facilities Available: Well equipped laboratories; library with collection of approximately
130,000 books and subscriptions for 375 journals/periodicals; six field stations; 60 personal computers
and one minicomputer.
Future Development Plans: To undertake research in fields of ecodevelopment, ecological
rehabilitation, tree improvement, biodiversity, biotechnology, and other aspects of forestry; conduct
postgraduate, PhD and DSc programmes in various disciplines of forestry and related sciences; develop
institute as centre of excellence
