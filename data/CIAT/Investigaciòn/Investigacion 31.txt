Future Development Plans: Research projects on rice wheat farming system, development of hybrids
of important crops sustainability of farming/cropping systems, biotechnology, food and agriculture policy,
environmental sciences, collection and conservation of peanuts/microorganisms and integrated nutrient
and pest management. Agriculture; Biology; Biochemistry/Biophysics; Environment.
Main Lines of Research and Training Activities: ICRISAT’s mandate is: (1) To serve as a world
centre for the improvement of grain yield and quality of sorghum, millets, chickpea, pigeonpea, and
groundnut and act as a world repository for the genetic resources of these groups; (2) Develop improved
farming systems that will help to increase and stabilize agricultural production through more effective use
of natural and human resources in the seasonally dry semi-arid tropics; (3) Identify constraints to
agricultural development in the semi-arid tropics and evaluate means of alleviating them through
technological and institutional changes; (4) Assist in the development and transfer of technology to the
farmer through cooperation with national and regional research programmes, and by sponsoring
workshops and conferences, operating training programmes and assisting extension activities.
Major Scientific Results or Products: Stabilizing production of groundnut in India and pearl millet in
West and Southern Africa: production of world’s first pigeonpea hybrid; nearly 160 genotypes of
sorghum, pearlmillet, chickpea, pigeonpea, and groundnut jointly developed by ICRISAT with NARS
have been released in 47 countries of the Americas, Africa and Asia.
Main Research Facilities Available: Adequate facilities to conduct strategic research at all locations of
ICRISAT available.
Future Development Plans: A medium-term plan has been designed and articulated into 12 global
multi-disciplinary research projects.
