Actors, Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives and
Projects in the Livestock Sector and in
Climate Change in Colombia
We identified 70 institutional actors with either direct or indirect
relation to climate change and the livestock sector in Colombia
(Figure 3). We also found that three major initiatives brought
most of the actors together, although the nature and thematic
agendas of the three are quite different. Briefly the three
initiatives are:
➢ MGS-Col is a multistakeholder (public-private) initiative with
47 members compromising the production and dissemination
of technical knowledge and actions that support projects,
programs and policies design, and implementation around
sustainable livestock activity.
➢ SLP is an initiative implemented by a strategic alliance
between the Colombian Federation of Cattlemen and the
National Cattle Fund (FEDEGAN-FNG), the Center for
Research in Sustainable Systems of Agricultural Production
(CIPAV), the Fund for Environmental Action and Childhood
(Fondo Acción), and The Nature Conservancy (TNC,
cofinanced by the Global Environment Fund (GEF),
administered by the World Bank (WB) and the British
Embassy. This projects seeks to improve livestock productivity
in an environmentally friendly manner; integrating different
types of technologies such as silvopastoral systems in livestock
production, and the conservation of native forests and natural
ecosystems on farms.
➢ NAMA SL is an initiative led by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development (MADR) with support from the Ministry
of Environment and Sustainable Development (MADS), which
seeks to identify mitigation activities to be implemented in
the Colombian livestock sector as a contribution to reduce
emission of GHG, according to the particular conditions of
each region in the country. This initiative have not ended in
a NAMA document yet but there is a NAMAs Information
Note of Sustainable Bovine Livestock document which one was
registered to united nations framework convention on climate
change (UNFCCC).
MGS-Col counts on 27% of the identified institutional actors,
followed by SLP (17%) and NAMA-SL (11%). Public institutions
are most involved in all three initiatives compared with private
companies, which are involved only in the MGS-Col. MGS-Col
has a good representation of actors and is open to others who
may be interested. It is recognized nationally and has influenced
policy despite limited participation by the private sector. It is
slow to make decisions because it represents such broad interests.
The SLP is technically strong and experienced in the field,
partly because of FEDEGAN’s involvement. While it can finance
technological change and provide technical assistance, it covers
just 0.4% of cattle farms. NAMA-SL aligns with the government’s
international commitments in the NDC process of the UNFCCC.
