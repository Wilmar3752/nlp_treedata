CIAT, building off 50 years of success in generating and strategically positioning knowledge to improve agricultural practices, reduce poverty and hunger, and improve human nutrition, continues to play a key role in addressing the world’s most pressing challenges related to agriculture, development, and the environment. During our recent 50th anniversary celebrations, time and time again, we heard our partners, supporters, and colleagues reference our ability to adapt and innovate. This is clearly a hallmark of CIAT’s approach to research for development.
