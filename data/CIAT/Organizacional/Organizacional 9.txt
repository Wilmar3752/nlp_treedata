CIAT has had a long history of engagement in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. By 2002,
positions of Regional Coordinators had been established for Africa, Asia and Central America
regions. Regional Coordinators were charged with the responsibility of working with
partners in the regions to develop joint agenda of common interest across the range of CIAT
projects. Until then, there were individual projects active in each region (e.g. cassava in Asia,
beans in Africa, hillsides in Central America), and there was no effective mechanism to
articulate the entire range of CIAT research competency with the needs and priorities of
NARS. In the same year the Tropical Soils Biology Fertility Institute (TSBF) was merged with
CIAT, which significantly enhanced CIAT’s presence in Africa.
As a consequence of these changes, activities in the regions have evolved into foci of co‐
coordinated research for development that address CIAT’s core mandate. The Regional
Coordinator positions were renamed as Regional Research Leaders in 2007 and together with
the DDG Research, the RDC Research Leaders, and the TSBF Director; they form the Research
Committee of CIAT.
The regional operations of CIAT have significantly expanded in Africa and Asia, while
diminishing in LAC since the time of the previous EPMR (2000). At that time activities in the
regions were embryonic and they did not receive separate review and assessment in that
report. At the present time, there are 145 total staff active in the regions (Table 5.1). By far the
largest contingent occurs in Africa (70 staff), but there is a significant presence in Asia (32
staff), and in LAC (23 staff).In this chapter we describe the regional operations, discuss their activities, and present an
overview assessment and synthesis leading to both specific recommendations within a region
and over‐arching recommendations concerning regional operations.
