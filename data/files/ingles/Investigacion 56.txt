Number of Research Scientists: 68; Number of Staff: 478.
Scientific Fields of Interest: Agriculture.
Main Lines of Research and Training Activities: Research at ICARDA focuses on areas with limited
winter rainfall and dry summers. Centre has global responsibilities for improvements of barley, lentil and
faba bean, and regional responsibilities, in West Asia and North Africa (WANA), for improvement of
wheat, chickpea, pasture and forage crops and related farming systems. Research/training: Germplasm
evaluation and enhancement (breeding, physiology, entomology, pathology, biotechnology); germplasm
collection and conservation; resource management and conservation (soils, water, vegetation);
management and improvement of pastures; livestock (small ruminant); nutrition; agronomy; agroecological characterization; socio-economic research associated with technology transfer, adoption and
impact assessments. ICARDA hosts MSc and PhD students and runs in-house long-term residential
courses, in-country training courses and individual short-term courses.
Major Scientific Results or Products: Improved varieties of barley, lentil and chickpeas (particularly
cold-tolerant chickpea varieties for winter sowing); collection and preservation of germplasm, including
land races and wild relatives; computerized spatial weather generator for scientific assessments of
weather conditions and characterization of crop environments; mechanized harvesting of lentil and
chickpea.
