On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the CGIAR, this paper revisits the genesis of the
international center model for agricultural research (IARC). This model became fashionable in the
1960s and was arguably the major institutional innovation of the 20th century for foreign assistance
to agriculture. While the founding of the first IARCs is universally attributed to the Rockefeller and
Ford Foundations, we argue that based on new evidence, the creation of the IARCs was a logical conclusion of a process involving many actors that began immediately after World War I. First, we review FAO
efforts to build regional and global research networks for the major cereals in the immediate post-WWII
period. These networks linked closely to USDA and its legacy of scientific collaboration across US states
that together with the Foundations, strongly influenced the design of the first two international centers
for the major cereals. In Latin America, the various efforts by the US National Academy of Sciences, the US
government and the countries of the region resulted in the creation of three centers for tropical agriculture, (only two of which exist today) with a broader research focus on farming systems and natural
resources. Finally, we show how the establishment of four IARCs in Africa in different ways drew on a
colonial legacy that had moved toward centralization of research across colonial territories since before
WWII. All of these efforts over many decades involved a good deal of experimentation in organization,
funding and governance to arrive at the standard IARC model that emerged. By the late 1960s, the genesis
of another six IARCs was already in place stimulating the creation of the CGIAR to fund and coordinate the
IARCs. The review concludes with a brief reflection on the successes and challenges of the IARC model
over 50 years, and its relevance today.
