Number of Research Scientists: 100; Number of Staff: 800.
Scientific Fields of Interest: Agriculture.
Main Lines of Research and Training Activities: Primary objective is to produce experimental maize
and wheat varieties that developing country partners — whether engaged in publicly or privately
supported research — can use to increase farm-level productivity while protecting environment.
CIMMYT distributes varieties to more than 100 countries through its international testing and distribution
networks. Collaborative research with dozens of advanced scientific institutions reinforces its efforts on
behalf of the developing world’s poor. In addition to producing improved varieties, its work generates new
scientific knowledge and more effective research procedures. CIMMYT maintains two of the world’s
largest collections of maize and wheat genetic resources. It supports national agricultural research
programmes through training, information services, and consulting.
Major Scientific Results or Products: Main products are improved varieties of maize and wheat
developed in collaboration with scientists from around the world. Varieties are grown on millions of
hectares in developing world. Some 4,000 people have been trained.
