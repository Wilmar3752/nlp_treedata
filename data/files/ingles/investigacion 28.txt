Scientific Fields of Interest: Agriculture; Biology; Biochemistry/Biophysics; Energy; Chemistry;
Environment.
Main Lines of Research and Training Activities: The major R&D programmes relate to plant
biotechnology, floriculture, tree biology, plant wealth utilization, environmental sciences and taxonomy
and ethnobotany. Major thrust area programmes are directed towards (i) basic and applied research in
plant molecular biology, biochemistry and stress physiology; (ii) standardization of agrotechniques and
package of practices for ornamental plants for nursery and cut-flower trade and development of new
cultivars; (iii) development of production and nursery technology for wood biomass and energy plantation
on sub-standard soils.
Major Scientific Results or Products: Development of 190 new cultivars of 15 well-known ornamental
plants; tissue culture protocols for a number of ornamental and medicinal plants and forest trees;
botanical authentication of more than 50 indigenous herbal drugs; extraction of industrial gum from
‘Dhaincha’, Sesbania aculeata seed; production of woody biomass on substandard soils sites; role of
calcium and calmodulin in regulating enzymes of nitrogen metabolism in plants; stable BT transgenic
tobacco plants raised; polymorphism studies in rice and sorghum; sequencing of 15 kb of populus
chloroplast genome; bipartite genome of tomato leaf curl virus cloned and sequenced; developed DNA
fingerprinting for Amaranthus as test system for biodiversity assessment. Examples of technologies
transferred: improvement of betelvine cultivation; cultivation of German Chamomile Chamomilla recutita
on substandard soils; agrotechnology for a high-yielding opium poppy variety, BROP-1, and grain
amaranth; tissue culture protocol for Populus deltoides clones G48 and G5.
Main Research Facilities Available: Botanical garden; herbarium; Banthra Research Station;
economic botany information service; wide range of modern sophisticated equipment/instruments for
conducting work in photosynthesis, biochemistry, molecular biology and plant tissue culture; several
testing and evaluation facilities — e.g., for irradiation of plants and plant materials with gamma rays, plant
identification, estimation and analyses of plant materials for proteins, amino acids, oils, fats, active
medicinal principles, gums, mucilages; pharmacognostical analyses of herbal drug formulations; library
holds more than 400 periodicals and nearly 50,000 books.
Future Development Plans: Plant molecular biology and biotechnology for developing transgenic
molecular biology and biotechnology for developing transgenic plants of tobacco/cotton/pulses
expressing a bacterial gene for toxicity to a variety of polyphagus insects; DNA fingerprinting with other
approaches for biodiversity assessment, identification of elite plant varieties, and for establishing
taxonomic relationships; development of silvicultural practices for cultivation of high biomass yielding
trees as renewable source of energy on waste lands; agrotechnologies for commercial cultivation of
ornamentals; environmental impact assessments.
