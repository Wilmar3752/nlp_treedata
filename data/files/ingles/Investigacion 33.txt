Scientific Fields of Interest: Environment; PGR Biodiversity.
Main Lines of Research and Training Activities: Exploration and collection of crop plant germplasm
including wild relatives; plant introduction and exchange; plant quarantine for germplasm under
exchange; germplasm characterization and evaluation; ex situ germplasm conservation - gene bank
modules, cryopreservation and tissue culture; molecular characterisation and DNA fingerprinting -
research back up. On-job training for orientating on PGR activities; postgraduate degree programme on
plant genetic resources.
Major Scientific Results or Products: Long-term ex situ conservation of 1.60 lakh seed samples of
agri-horticultural crops, standardisation of protocols for tissue culture and cryopreservation for several
plant species; development of several quarantine treatments for salvaging infected germplasm.
Main Research Facilities Available: Scanning electron microscope, ELISA reader; laboratory facilities
for DNA fingerprinting, cryopreservation, tissue culture, orthodox seed conservation,
phytochemical/biochemical evaluation, plant quarantine clearance and supportive research; 100 acres
research farm; 10 regional stations with farms; well developed computer facilities for database.
Future Development Plans: Integration of ex situ, on farm and in situ conservation; protocols for longterm cryopreservation/tissue culture conservation; molecular characterisation of varieties, germplasm;
centre of excellence for HRD and PhD degree programme.
