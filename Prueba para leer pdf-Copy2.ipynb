INTRODUCTION This document develops the guidelines of the PNC National Competitiveness Policy approved by the CNC National Competitiveness Commission last July . The Commission established the following five pillars for the competitiveness policy development of world-class sectors or clusters jump in productivity and employment business and labor formalization promotion of science, technology and innovation and transversal strategies to promote competition and investment. The development made in this document consists of presenting action plans to achieve the objectives implicit in each of the five previously defined pillars. In this sense, action plans are proposed in different work areas of competitiveness. The preparation of these action plans has been led by the ministries or entities directly responsible. I. BACKGROUND A. Legal Background The relevant legal background for this document begins with the decree that created the National Competitiveness Council. As of November, with the issuance of the decree of the Mixed Commission of Trade Ex Later, he assumed the functions of the Advisory Council to the President of the Republic on issues of productivity and competitiveness. The Commission raised and promoted the development of the Export Strategic Plan and as part of this plan in the year the Ministry of Foreign Trade launched the National Productivity and Competitiveness Policy PNPC. This policy had three main instruments, one transversal based on the Red Colombia Compite, one sectoral based on the signing of competitiveness agreements and one regional based on the Regional Advisory Committees for Foreign Trade Carce. The Conpes of July resumed the public policy on competitiveness with the definition of the Internal Agenda for Productivity and Competitiveness AI. The results of the national process that began with that Conpes were presented to public opinion last April. One of the direct effects of the AI \\u200b\\u200bwas to convince the country of the need to have a permanent institutional framework for reflection on competitiveness issues. As a consequence, in the second half of the year, the High Presidential Council for Competitiveness and Productivity was created and subsequently the August Conpes was issued, creating the National Administrative System for Competitiveness SNC defines that the National Competitiveness Commission is the highest advisory body of the The National Government in matters of competitiveness establishes that the technical secretariat of the System rests with the Director of the DNP and orders the production of a National Competitiveness Policy. As a result of these decisions, the country became involved in an active agenda for the creation of Regional Competitiveness Commissions that are the regional expression of the SNC and that gather the experience of the Carce, among others. The August decree was issued to develop the Conpes. This decree was later modified by the January decree that changes the composition of the CNC and defines that the technical secretariat will be mixed and will be made up of the director of the DNP and a delegate from the private sector appointed by the CNC. An additional modification of the decree was the May decree that includes the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism in the technical secretariat and defines that this Ministry, with the support of Confecamaras, will exercise the coordination of the Regional Competitiveness Commissions. As a development of the recommendations contained in the Conpes, the CNC at its meeting in July approved a long-term vision, a conceptual framework and some general pillars for the competitiveness policy. B. Institutional background Colombia today has a consolidated National Competitiveness System with broad participation from academia, companies, workers, regions, and public authorities. The participation of members of civil society in the National Competitiveness Commission is . In the Regional Competitiveness Commissions, the business sector participates with the academy and the labor sector with . To date, the Commission has met five times, approving its operating regulations, the work plan for and the operation of the Regional Competitiveness Commissions, the monitoring and evaluation scheme for competitiveness goals and the design of the national competitiveness policy. Additionally, it established actions to promote foreign investment in Colombia as a result of the International Development Ireland IDI study contracted by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism and Proexport. Under this scheme, the Presidential High Council for Competitiveness led the creation of ten mixed technical committees to support the National Competitiveness Commission Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures SPS Air Transport Logistics and Transportation Biofuels Sustainability Biodiversity Construction Tourism Jewelry and Technology Transfer offsets. Additionally, the Presidential High Council together with the GRAT are advancing in a strategy to rationalize and automate the procedures that have been identified as critical by businessmen Andi Acopi and Confecamaras and prepare a second Anti-Procedures Law that must be presented in the next legislature. This work will allow Colombia to improve its investment climate and therefore its position in the World Bank\\'s Doing Business ranking. In parallel with the above, at the regional level, the work has been articulated around the Regional Competitiveness Commissions that are coordinated at the national level by the National Coordination of CRC. In accordance with the structure of the National Procedures Rationalization and Automation Group System and the Administrative Department of the Civil Service as the governing body of the Anti-Procedures Competitiveness policy, the Regional Commissions are a form of institutional organization that strengthens the different spaces for consultation between the public and private actors and organizations civic and social organizations of the region with the purpose of articulating the regional priorities in terms of productivity and competitiveness with the transversal and sectorial priorities that are analyzed in the CNC while seeking to guarantee the regions their access to the programs and the formulation of policies on competitiveness and productivity. Within this framework, these commissions have been installed. The country\\'s departments belong to the National Competitiveness System. During the first semester of this year, the High Council carried out a follow-up of the training processes, diagnosis, planning and management of the installed Commissions, an activity that will continue in the second semester. The SNC is supporting the development of regional competitiveness plans with resources and direction from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism and the DNP for millions, also promoting their inclusion in departmental development plans. Additionally, as a result of the subnational Doing Business study financed by USAID and the World Bank, the leading cities for doing business in the country presented concrete actions to strengthen the investment climate in the regions. C. Justification This Conpes document is promoted by the National Competitiveness System and in particular by the High Presidential Council for Productivity and Competitiveness, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Tourism, the Private Competitiveness Council and the National Planning Department. Meta Santander Boyacá Bolívar Risaralda Valle Antioquia The competitiveness policy based on AI is the backbone of the growth strategy of the chapter of the National Development Plan Community State development for all. Thanks to democratic security, the investor confidence derived from it and a favorable environment, GDP grew by . figure not recorded for nearly years. The National Competitiveness Policy is conceived as an instrument that allows this type of growth to be sustained in the long term. A fundamental characteristic of this document is its articulating purpose that tries to incorporate within the common framework of competitiveness a great variety of government policies, some of which in their own right can lead to a Conpes document. In this way, the effort consists in designing public policies taking into account, among other criteria, their impact on the country\\'s competitiveness. This aspect is given the greatest importance. The Executive Committee of the SNC considered a draft of this Conpes document in December and decided that its architecture would be based on action plans led by the ministries or entities directly responsible. This decision is answered in this document. II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK Competitiveness is a complex term that admits multiple definitions. The least controversial way to measure it is through productivity. Competitiveness is understood as a complement to the environmental conditions for growth. In particular, growth has some necessary conditions that have to do with physical and legal security and macroeconomic stability. The importance of these conditions is vital. In this document no considerations are made about the environmental conditions in the understanding that these must be satisfied. A competitiveness policy does not replace Democratic Security or a healthy and stable macroeconomic environment, but rather complements them and makes it possible to enhance their effect on growth. The question is what is the role of the State in improving productivity. In this document it is understood that since the private sector is primarily responsible for productivity, the role of the State is to facilitate the productive efforts of the private sector. This facilitation can occur on at least three levels: the provision of public goods that play the role of production inputs to improve the productivity and competitiveness of Colombian firms, the promotion of public-private productive alliances, and the promotion of the regional dimension of the competitiveness. In this document it is understood that increases in the profitability of the private sector must come essentially from increases in productivity and not from undesirable sources such as rent hunting or the reduction of labor costs. On the contrary, it is expected that it will be the increase in productivity that will allow a sustained increase in the real income of Colombians. It is also understood that the long-term objective of a competitiveness policy must be to reduce protection and promote competition in the productive apparatus. For the preparation of this document, the CNC approved some general guidelines that can be summarized in a vision, a conceptual framework and some pillars of action. The vision says EU In Colombia it will be one of the three most competitive countries in Latin America and will have a high level of income per person equivalent to that of a country with medium-high income through an export economy of goods and services with high added value and innovation with a business environment that encourages local and foreign investment promotes regional convergence improves formal employment opportunities raises the quality of life and substantially reduces poverty levels” CNC session of July . The conceptual framework establishes that the objective of the competitiveness policy is to achieve the productive transformation of the country. A country can increase the value of its production in three ways by producing more, increasing productivity, producing better, increasing quality, or producing new products, productive transformation. Although in general none of these three fronts can be neglected, Colombia must make a greater relative effort in the third since it has practically exhausted the sources of growth in the first two. Lastly, the general pillars approved are development of world-class sectors or clusters promotion of productivity and employment labor and business formalization promotion of science, technology and innovation and transversal strategies see figure . Figure Pillars of competitiveness policy Vision Productive transformation Development of world - class cluster sectors Leap in productivity Business and labor formalization Science , technology and innovation Cross - cutting strategies HAUSMANN Ricardo and KLINGER Bailey Achieving Export Led Growth in Colombia Quantum Advisory Group May . III. DIAGNOSIS A. Central problem According to international measurements of competitiveness, Colombia has plenty of room for improvement. Three very common international indicators of competitiveness are the Global Competitiveness Index prepared by the World Economic Forum WEF, the Competitiveness Index of the Institute for Management Development IMD of Switzerland and the Ease of Doing Business Index of the World Bank DB. According to the latest data, Colombia occupies the position among countries in the FEM, in the IMD the position among countries and in the DB the position among countries, see tables a . In addition, as can be seen in the figures, there is no clear trend towards improvement in these indicators in recent years. Only DB Colombia had a significant improvement in the last year.

On average, the country\\'s relative productivity adjusted for purchasing power is only one-fifth that of the United States. By sectors, financial services, which is the most productive in relative terms, barely has the productivity of the same sector in the United States economy . The sectors that lag behind in productivity such as agriculture and real estate services do not exceed the productivity exhibited by the same sector in the United States see figure .

Real Estate Employment Source Calculations McKinsey DNP The low productivity of the national economy is reflected in a loss of competitiveness compared to other countries in the world that have advanced faster than Colombia in terms of per capita income growth. This is how, for example, for a sample of countries, the position of Colombia\\'s GDP per inhabitant fell from position in to position in . If the growth trends of those years were maintained in other years, Colombia would be surpassed in GDP per capita by the percentage of the world\\'s population. Colombia still has a long way to go to be classified as an upper-middle income country. dollars of per capita income. The time it takes us to reach that goal depends on the rate of growth. To reach the goal in the coming years, GDP per capita must grow at a rate close to one percent. On the other hand, if we grow to Source Global Insight–World Market Monitor database analysis McKinsey. the average growth rate of the period percent it will take us years to reach that goal. In short, in order to change our development possibilities, it is crucial to sustain for long periods the growth levels that the Colombian economy has been showing recently. The promotion of competitiveness is a long-term concern, but it is not a concern that we can leave to the long term. B. Problem axes Measurements of competitiveness such as those mentioned in the description of the central problem make it possible to identify the following problem axes that prevent Colombia from being more competitive. . . . . . . . . . . . Little sophistication and low value added in production processes. Low productivity and capacity to generate employment in the formal sectors. In particular, low productivity in the agricultural sector. High levels of business and labor informality. Low levels of innovation and technology absorption. Little depth and sophistication of the financial market. Deficiencies in transportation and energy infrastructure. Low quality and little relevance of education. Tax structure unfriendly to competitiveness. Lag in penetration of information technologies and connectivity. Environmental degradation as a limitation of competitiveness. Institutional weakness related to competitiveness. V. A. OBJECTIVES Purpose of the document The general purpose of this document is summarized in the vision that has been set for the National Competitiveness Policy. In short, it is about making the country more competitive. This would not only allow us to improve our competitiveness rankings, but would also contribute to sustaining the growth rate. In this way, it is possible to reduce the existing gap with upper-middle income countries. Additionally, increasing competitiveness is a preponderant requirement to successfully insert ourselves into the global economy. Finally, increasing competitiveness generates formal employment opportunities and combats poverty and inequality. In this sense, increases in competitiveness are a fundamental tool for socioeconomic development and collective prosperity. B. Objectives As specific objectives we propose to advance on issues that have been identified as crucial for competitiveness. For each of them, under the leadership of the Ministry or responsible entity, a specific action plan has been created. The resulting action plans can be understood as a development of the five general pillars previously defined for the competitiveness policy. The work of specifying the action plans has made it possible to link a series of efforts that the Government has been undertaking on various fronts and group them into a global vision of national competitiveness. The specific objectives or action plans are described in the box. It is important to point out that these action plans have been designed under current budget restrictions. Table Action plans I.

Action Plans Each of the proposed action plans is described below. In each action plan, some strategic axes are first defined, in some cases with associated specific objectives. In turn, for each strategic axis and specific objective, if applicable, a matrix of products and activities is developed that includes monitoring indicators, goals, deadlines and responsible parties. These matrices will allow the National Competitiveness System to permanently monitor the progress of the action plans. For each action plan we present an abbreviated description of the plan with its strategic axes and specific objectives and the product and activity matrixes that describe the details of each of the plans. i. Promotion of world-class sectors The strategy for the promotion of world-class sectors has been led by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism. In addition to the development of business plans for these sectors, this action plan seeks to adapt the regulatory and legislative framework to a more competitive environment, promote competition and legal stability, attract more national and foreign investment, expand and deepen free trade agreements and double taxation and consolidate spaces for public-private dialogue.

Compliance with contracts Compliance with contracts is one of the factors taken into account by the Doing Business study in its measurement of the ease of doing business in countries. It refers in particular to the efficiency of the judicial system to resolve a judicial dispute of a commercial nature and is one of the variables in which Colombia shows a less satisfactory performance in the Doing Business of ranking in that component. One of the objectives set forth in the PND is the adaptation and modernization of the management models of the Legal System. In this regard, both the Ministry of the Interior and Justice and the Superior Council of the Judiciary have advanced actions for the design of medium and long-term plans in order to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency in the provision of the justice service. In this sense, it is not only intended to achieve the optimization and modernization of the Justice service, but also to carry out actions that result in a better provision of the service that will increase the country\\'s competitiveness. Thus, the DNP has worked on the creation of a work table in which the Superior Council of the Judiciary, Ministry of Foreign Trade, Industry and Tourism and the Ministry of the Interior and Justice participate, whose purpose is to build proposals that allow the ranking to be increased. of the contract compliance indicator” that is part of the World Bank\\'s Doing Business methodology.
